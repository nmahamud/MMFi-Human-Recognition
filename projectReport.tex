    This is a project that uses mmWave radar for action recognition of humans.

\section{Introduction}
Identifying actions that humans perform is always a challenging thing a computer has to do. But it enables us to use the computer in different ways, often without even touching anything. 
Existing works have focused on identifying actions in a completely empty room with only a single person in view. With our project, we should be closer to recognizing the actions even though the radar is picking up other information.

\section{Related Work}

What is/are the current state of the art and what are the limitations to current approaches?


\section{Methodology}
Describe in detail what you're doing. The level of detail should be sufficient for someone to implement your work after reading this section.

\section{Dataset and Experiments}
If using existing dataset: Describe what dataset has - all the fields and why you're using it. How many subjects? How many samples?

If collecting you own data: Describe what data is being collected, how? How many subjects? How many samples?

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Metrics}
What are the metrics being used to evaluate your system and why? Examples: True Positive Rate, Accuracy, F-1 Score, Balanced Accuracy, etc.

\subsection{Baselines}
What are you comparing your system with? A baseline can be a simple straw solution or an existing approach.

\subsection{Results}
This is the most important part of the report. Please include graphs to present your results and explain them.

\section{Conclusion}
